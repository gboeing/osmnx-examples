    "*Note* the plot above shows the network within 500m (traveling distance along the network) from the `location_point`. By default, the `network_type` parameter value is 'all', meaning that we do not filter out paths that restrict certain types of traffic. This also means that one-way streets are honored as one-way and you cannot travel the wrong direction down them. Thus, the 500m takes into account only those nodes you can reach within 500m while only traveling in the allowed direction of the street. Instead (below), we can specify `network_type='walk'` to build a street network only of paths that walking is allowed on. This also makes every path bi-directional in the directed network, because you can walk in either direction on the sidewalk of a one-way street. Thus, the 500m now takes into account those nodes you can reach within 500m while traveling in either direction (even if it's a one-way street)."

    "## Part 3: simplifying street network topology\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplification is normally done by OSMnx automatically under the hood, but we can break it out to see how it works. OpenStreetMap nodes are weird. They include intersections, but they also include all the points along a single block where the street curves. The latter are not nodes in the graph theory sense, so we remove them algorithmically and consolidate the set of edges between \"true\" network nodes into a single edge. There are two simplification modes, strict and non-strict. The main difference is that unlike strict mode, non-strict mode allows simplification to an \"expansion graph\" (ie, if the graph were undirected, nodes with degree 2 as long as the incident edges have different OSM IDs). For a more in-depth demonstration of topological simplification with OSMnx, see [this notebook](04-simplify-graph-consolidate-nodes.ipynb)."
