    "## 1. Complex intersection consolidation\n",
    "\n",
    "Many real-world street networks feature complex intersections and traffic circles, resulting in a cluster of graph nodes where there is really just one true intersection, as we would think of it in transportation or urban design. Similarly, divided roads are often represented by separate centerline edges: the intersection of two divided roads thus creates 4 nodes, representing where each edge intersects a perpendicular edge, but these 4 nodes represent a single intersection in the real world. Traffic circles similarly create a cluster of nodes where each street's edge intersects the roundabout.\n",

    "Notice how the traffic circles' many nodes are merged into a new single centroid node, with edge geometries extended to connect to it. Similar consolidation occurs at the intersection of the divided roads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running `consolidate_intersections` with `rebuild_graph=True` may yield somewhat (but not very) different intersection counts/densities compared to `rebuild_graph=False`. The difference lies in that the latter just merges buffered node points that overlap, whereas the former checks the topology of the overlapping node buffers before merging them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This prevents topologically remote but spatially proximate nodes from being merged. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - A street intersection may lie directly below a freeway overpass's intersection with an on-ramp. We would not want to merge these together and connnect their edges: they are distinct junctions in the system of roads.\n",
    "  - In a residential neighborhood, a bollarded street may create a dead-end immediately next to an intersection or traffic circle. We would not want to merge this dead-end with the intersection and connect their edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples illustrate (two-dimensional) geometric proximity, but topological remoteness. Accordingly, in some situations we may expect higher intersection counts when using `rebuild_graph=True` because it is more cautious with merging in these cases. The trade-off is that it has higher time complexity than `rebuild_graph=False`.\n",

    "## 3. Cleaning up the periphery of the network\n",
    "\n",
    "This is related to simplification. OSMnx by default (with clean_periphery parameter equal to True) buffers the area you request by 0.5km, and then retrieves the street network within this larger, buffered area. Then it simplifies the topology so that nodes represent intersections of streets (rather than including all the interstitial OSM nodes). Then it calculates the (undirected) degree of each node in this larger network. Next it truncates this network by the actual area you requested (either by bounding box, or by polygon). Finally it saves a dictionary of node degree values as a graph attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has two primary benefits. First, it cleans up stray false edges around the periphery. If clean_periphery=False, peripheral non-intersection nodes within the requested area appear to be cul-de-sacs, as the rest of the edge leading to an intersection outside the area is ignored. If clean_periphery=True, the larger graph is first created, allowing simplification of such edges to their true intersections, allowing their entirety to be pruned after truncating down to the actual requested area. Second, it gives accurate node degrees by both a) counting node neighbors even if they fall outside the retained network (so you don't claim a degree-4 node is degree-2 because only 2 of its neighbors lie within the area), and b) not counting all those stray false edges' terminus nodes as cul-de-sacs that otherwise grossly inflate the count of nodes with degree=1, even though these nodes are really just interstitial nodes in the middle of a chopped-off street segment between intersections."
