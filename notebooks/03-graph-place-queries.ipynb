    "OSMnx lets you download street network data and build topologically corrected multidigraphs, project to UTM and plot the networks, and save the street network as SVGs, GraphML files, or GeoPackages for later use. The street networks are directed and preserve one-way directionality. API responses can be cached locally so OSMnx doesn't have to request the same data from the API multiple times: saving bandwidth, increasing speed, and enabling reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download a street network by providing OSMnx any of the following:\n",
    "  - a bounding box\n",
    "  - a lat-long point plus a distance (either distance along the network, or cardinal)\n",
    "  - an address plus a distance (either distance along the network, or cardinal)\n",
    "  - a place name or list of place names (for OSMnx to automatically geocode and get the boundary of)\n",
    "  - a polygon of the desired street network's boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also specify several different built-in network types:\n",
    "  - `drive` - get drivable public streets (but not service roads)\n",
    "  - `drive_service` - get drivable streets, including service roads\n",
    "  - `walk` - get all streets and paths that pedestrians can use (this network type ignores one-way directionality)\n",
    "  - `bike` - get all streets and paths that cyclists can use\n",
    "  - `all` - download all non-private OSM streets and paths\n",
    "  - `all_private` - download all OSM streets and paths, including private-access ones\n",
    "\n",
    "Or you can define your own fine-tuned network type using OSMnx's `custom_filter` parameter (to get just highways, or railways, canals, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Query/download place boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "The `graph_from_place` function uses place boundary geocoding logic to find the network within your place's boundary. Let's look briefly at this place boundary querying before we get to street networks. You can download by cities, neighborhoods, boroughs, counties, states, or countries: anything with geocodable polygon boundaries in OSM's database. Notice the polygon geometries represent political boundaries, not physical/land boundaries. OSMnx will turn your geocoded place (or multiple places) boundaries into a geopandas GeoDataFrame."
