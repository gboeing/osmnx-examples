[OSMnx](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx) is a Python package to work with street networks and other spatial data from OpenStreetMap: retrieve, model, analyze, and visualize street networks as well as other infrastructure types, points of interest, building footprints, speed/travel time, elevation, and more.

This repo contains usage examples and feature demonstrations. You can run these OSMnx example notebooks interactively online with [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gboeing/osmnx-examples/master?urlpath=lab) or locally with the official OSMnx [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/gboeing/osmnx). All of the examples are in this repo's [notebooks](notebooks) folder. Note that this repo's master branch generally tracks the functionality of the OSMnx repo's master branch. For examples corresponding to previous versions, use this repo's tags to browse by release.
